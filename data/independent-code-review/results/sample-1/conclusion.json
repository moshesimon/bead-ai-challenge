    "reasoning": "Assessment by control attribute with evidence references:\n\n1) Code reviews are performed prior to committing a change to the main branch\n- The PR shows it was merged into the main branch (\u201cMerged\u201d badge and merge event) and the Reviewers panel shows an approved review (green check) on the PR prior to merge. In GitHub, enabling auto-merge requires required approvals and passing checks; the PR shows auto-merge enabled and then merged, which implies the approval existed before the merge event.\n- Evidence:\n  - PR merged into main: data/independent-code-review/samples/sample-1/Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 14-28-31 Shrink relationComplexityError test size by jakebailey \u00b7 Pull Request #62754 \u00b7 microsoft_TypeScript.png (see \u201cMerged\u201d header and merge event near bottom)\n  - Reviewers panel showing an approved review (green check): tmp_crops/34dc384253fb4228ac9f137c35ccf59a.png\n  - Merge event: tmp_crops/64158b234825418da37d01750b8f06f8.png\nConclusion for this attribute: SUCCESS\n\n2) Code Review approvals are performed by independent code reviewers\n- The author/assignee account on the PR differs from the approving reviewer account in the Reviewers panel, demonstrating independence (two different accounts).\n- Evidence:\n  - Reviewers panel with approved review and separate Assignees/author: tmp_crops/34dc384253fb4228ac9f137c35ccf59a.png\n  - PR header showing author on the PR: tmp_crops/4f6e5a2247c64eacb04f77497c911db0.png\nConclusion for this attribute: SUCCESS\n\n3) Testing is performed in accordance with the testing policy\n- CI executed on the pull request before merge; all listed jobs in the workflow are green and overall status is Success. Test results are visible in the PR checks.\n- A \u201ccoverage\u201d job/artifact is present and a separate coverage report shows:\n  - Statements (line) coverage \u2248 94.62% (>= 80% requirement)\n  - Branch coverage \u2248 89.48% (>= 70% requirement)\n  - Functions coverage \u2248 94.79% (>= 80% requirement)\n- Multiple test suites ran (e.g., test matrices across OS/Node versions, browser-integration, smoke), consistent with the policy\u2019s requirement to run tests in CI prior to merge and have all tests pass.\n- Evidence:\n  - CI run summary with all jobs green and coverage artifact: data/independent-code-review/samples/sample-1/Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 14-29-21 Shrink relationComplexityError test size \u00b7 microsoft_TypeScript@9e76dd2.png\n  - Coverage report meeting thresholds: data/independent-code-review/samples/sample-1/Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 14-27-50 Coverage Report.png\n  - PR checks visible: tmp_crops/4f6e5a2247c64eacb04f77497c911db0.png\nConclusion for this attribute: SUCCESS\n\nOverall determination:\n- Independent review occurred and is evidenced on the PR.\n- The PR merged only after CI passed, and coverage thresholds from the coverage report exceed the policy\u2019s minimums."

The Actions run associated with this PR shows \u201cStatus: Success\u201d and displays multiple jobs, including numerous \u201ctest \u2026\u201d matrix entries. The PR header also shows many checks (e.g., \u201cChecks 18\u201d).\n- Evidence:\n  - data/independent-code-review/samples/sample-2/Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 14-31-38 feat use Node.js timers by default \u00b7 denoland_deno@12cde71.png (Actions page shows \u201cStatus: Success\u201d for the PR run, with test jobs listed).\n  - data/independent-code-review/samples/sample-2/Screenshot 2025-11-14 at 14-32-05 feat use Node.js timers by default by bartlomieju \u00b7 Pull Request #31272 \u00b7 denoland_deno.png (PR shows a high number of checks associated with the change).\n- Gaps vs. the policy:\n  - The policy requires minimum coverage thresholds (unit \u226580% line; branch \u226570%; function \u226580%; critical paths 100%), and coverage reports to be generated and reviewed in the PR. No evidence of coverage artifacts or a coverage summary is visible in the screenshots.\n  - The policy also calls for visibility of test results in PR checks (which is present), but additionally references passing integration, end-to-end, performance (if applicable), and security tests. The screenshots do not explicitly show these specific suites or their results.\n- What additional evidence would satisfy this attribute:\n  - A coverage report summary or PR check output showing coverage metrics meeting thresholds.\n  - PR checks or Action logs explicitly showing unit, integration, end-to-end, performance (if applicable), and security scans all passing.\n  - If certain suites are not applicable, an approved exception/waiver per the policy.\n\nOverall assessment for this sample:\n- Two attributes are clearly met (review before merge to main; independent approval).\n- Testing ran and passed in CI, but evidence is insufficient to confirm full adherence to the testing policy\u2019s specific coverage thresholds and required suites."
